					This application is a simple inventory management system. It interacts
					with an API to access a live database so the information modified,
					created, or deleted on this application will impact the database. Feel
					free to mess around with the application in anyway you feel like.
					Using the above links in the navigation bar will allow you to interact
					with the various functions of this application. What each page does is
					described below.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Note*</b> When there are more than 5 items in the inventory list,
					every table will have pagination enabled allowing you to use the
					previous/next buttons to view the inventory list in 5 item increments.

					current quantity.
